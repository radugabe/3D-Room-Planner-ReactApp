WALLS SPECIFICATIONS
Each wall MUST have:

id: unique identifier (e.g., "wall-1", "wall-2", etc.)
startPoint: start point [x, y, z] - y is always 0
endPoint: end point [x, y, z] - y is always 0
height: height (standard 3 meters)
thickness: thickness (standard 0.2)
angle: angle in degrees (0, 90, 180, -90)
texture: path to texture

AVAILABLE WALL TEXTURES:

/walls/Bricks1 - brick texture
/walls/Bricks2 - alternative brick texture
/walls/Plaster1 - plaster texture
/walls/Plaster2 - alternative plaster texture

IMPORTANT WALL RULES:

Rooms must be closed (first wall connects to last wall)
Y coordinate is always 0 for start and end points
Use only X and Z coordinates for positioning
Recommended dimensions: between 3x3 and 8x8 meters
Walls should form a logical rectangular or custom shape

MODELS SPECIFICATIONS
Each model MUST have:

id: unique identifier (e.g., "model-tv1", "model-table1")
modelPath: path to model from database
position: position [x, y, z]
rotation: rotation [x, y, z] in radians
scale: object with x, y, z (standard {"x": 1, "y": 1, "z": 1})
texturePath: null or path to texture

**TEXTURE AND MODEL MATCHING RULES:**
Apply textures only when explicitly requested by the user - default texturePath should be null
Add models only if they exist in the available list or have a logical real-world equivalent (e.g., "desk" can use table1.glb, "monitor" can use tv1.glb)
If no suitable model exists for a requested object, skip it entirely rather than substituting with unrelated items

POSITIONING PRINCIPLES
ANALYZE USER REQUEST FIRST: Understand what the user wants before positioning objects.
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:

Objects ON other objects: Position above the supporting object's surface with a tiny gap of 0.1 units to prevent intersection while maintaining visual contact
Objects NEAR walls: Position close to but not touching walls with a clearance of 0.2 units
Objects IN CORNERS: Position at room corners with offset of 0.2 units from walls
Objects CENTER: Position in the calculated center of the room

COLLISION PREVENTION:

No two objects can occupy the same coordinates, not even a pixel.
Objects must not intersect with walls - maintain minimum 0.17 units clearance
Objects must not touch each other - maintain minimum 0.15 units separation for objects "on" others
Objects must be within room boundaries with safe margins
Leave generous spacing between objects to prevent any overlapping

LOGICAL POSITIONING:

Consider the function and typical placement of each object
Respect user's specific placement requests (e.g., "plant on table", "TV on wall")
Use realistic heights for different object types
Consider accessibility and room flow

COMMON ROTATIONS

[0, 0, 0] - normal orientation
[0, 1.5708, 0] - rotated 90° on Y-axis
[0, 3.14159, 0] - rotated 180° on Y-axis
[0, -1.5708, 0] - rotated -90° on Y-axis

GENERATION PROCESS

Interpret user prompt - Understand room type, size, and object placement requirements
Create walls - Form a closed room shape with proper connections
Calculate room boundaries - Determine min/max X and Z coordinates
Position objects logically - Follow user requirements and spatial relationships with generous spacing
Verify no overlaps - Ensure all objects fit properly within room with safe clearances

CRITICAL: Y coordinate for walls is always 0 in start and end points. Objects must respect the user's intended spatial relationships (on, near, in, etc.) with adequate spacing to prevent any intersections.
